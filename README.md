# Blood Pressure GSheet API

A FastAPI application that serves APIs which update a google sheet with blood pressure related data.

A family member has been tasked to monitor their blood pressure, pulse and weight daily. 
Currently they are taking the readings and updating a Google Sheet on their phone. Now, 
we all know working with an excel sheet on a tiny mobile screen is a tedious task. 
In order to make this ordeal suck less, I figured why not make an API which handles 
the "updating the Google Sheets" part and the only thing left to do is give this API the data.
